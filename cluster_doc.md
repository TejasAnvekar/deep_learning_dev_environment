<h3>Introduction to Slurm: The Job Scheduler</h3>
  </summary>

Slurm is the job scheduler we use. Here we will go into depth about some elements of the scheduler. There are many more 
features of Slurm that go beyond the scope of this guide, but all that you as a user need to know should be available.

The compute nodes are under a single slurm partition, called ```defq```. By using ```sinfo```
you can get the following info:
```bash
PARTITION AVAIL  TIMELIMIT  NODES  STATE NODELIST
defq*        up   infinite      1  idle~ gpu05
defq*        up   infinite      2    mix gpu[01,08]
defq*        up   infinite      5  alloc gpu[02-04,06-07]
```

where you will see the current state of each compute node. If you want to check the current queue of jobs
you can use the ```squeue``` command. If you add the  ```-u $USER``` argument you get a list of your current jobs.
If you want to sumbit a job in the cluster used the following two methods. **NEVER EVER RUNS JOBS DIRECTLY ON THE
LOGIN/HEAD NODE.**

<h3>Batch Jobs</h3>
  </summary>

In order to submit a batch job you can use the ```sbatch``` command. ```sbatch``` is a non-blocking command, meaning 
there is not a circumstance where running the command will cause it to hold. Even if the resources requested are not 
available, the job will be thrown into the queue and will start to run once resources become available.

```sbatch``` is based around running a single file. That being said, you shouldnâ€™t need to specify any parameters in 
the command other than ```sbatch <batch file>```, because you can specify all parameters in the command inside the file itself.

The following is an example of a batch script. Please note that the top of the script must start with ```#!/bin/bash```, 
and then immediately follow with ```#SBATCH <param> parameters```. An example of common SBATCH parameters and a 
simple script is below. 

```bash
#SBATCH -o res_%j.txt      # output file
#SBATCH -e res_%j.err      # File to which STDERR will be written
#SBATCH -J <job-name>      #
#SBATCH --partition=defq   # Partition to submit to
#SBATCH --ntasks=1         # Number of tasks
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=2  # Number of cores per task
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:1       # Number of GPUs
#SBATCH --mem=50000        # Memory in MB
#SBATCH --time=3-00:00     # Maximum runtime in D-HH:MM

python ...
```

This script will allocate 2 CPUs, 1 GPU and 50,000MB of RAM in the defq partition for up to 3 days.

<h3>Interactive Jobs</h3>
  </summary>

You can use the ```srun``` command in order to run interactive jobs. ```srun``` is a blocking command and it will not let
you execute other commands until this command (job) is finished. You can create an interactive job by using the same arguments
as in a batch script (see the following example):

```bash
srun -c 1 -n 1 -p defq --mem=100 --gres=gpu:0 -t 01:00 --pty /bin/bash
```
